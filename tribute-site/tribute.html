                    <h2 id="legend">The man; the legend</h2>
                    <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug was a godlike animal whose contributions to wheat technology are surpassed only by his modesty.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug didn't just know a lot about wheat. He knew EVERYTHING about wheat. Some say that he could take one look at a wheat kernel and recite the first ten thousand characters of its genome sequence. This talent no doubt stood him in good stead with the shamans of the hinterlands, who raised him from a young pup to the titan we know and love.</p>

                        <img class="fig-image" src="http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/norman-borlaug.jpg">
                        <p class="fig-caption">"C, C, G, A, T, C..."</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 id="rise">His rise to greatness</h2>
                    <p>Dr. Borlaug's rise to greatness was not always plain sailing. He tried his hand at several professions---all without success---and had almost given up hope when he finally discovered his talent.</p>

                    <p>It was a late summer eve in the year 1876 when a young Borlaug was conducting a solo expedition in search of gooseberries to feed his tribe. Borlaug found no gooseberries. Utterly disconsolate, he wept in the shade of the redwoods. In what was arguably the most fortuitous coincidence of this millenium, Borlaug's tears fell onto a dying plant, whose species we now recognise as wheat.</p>

                    <p>The wheat plant became turgid and ripe immediately, and Borlaug brought it back to his ancestral homelands. The rest, as they say, is history. Other historians have already discussed in detail Borlaug's breeding programmes, rise to Supreme Chieftain, and the subsequent domination of all grass-based life-forms in the Maize Jihad. No, with this article I merely present a humble epitaph to the great man.</p>

                    <h2 id="reaping">The reaping</h2>
                    <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug died in 2018 at the age of 457. A lifetime of optimal wheat diet could only stave off death for so long. The Grim Reaper must surely have noted the irony that the reaping of Borlaug's soul in death mirrored the harvesting of the crop to which he devoted his life.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Borlaug's remains were compressed to the size of a small marble by magnetic fields, and stored in a ceremonial stasis orb which will preserve them for thousands of years. The orb was planted in Nebraska, and it is said that wheat grows on the grave year-round, in a state of permanent ripeness.</p>
