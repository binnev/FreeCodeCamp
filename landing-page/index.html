        <h2 id="discovering">Discovering lino printing</h2>
        <p>This YouTube video was one of my first exposures to linocut printing. I was blown away by the bright colours and the contrast between layers, and I immediately wanted to give this process a try.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://reliefprint.myshopify.com/" target="_blank">The work of Ian Phillips</a> was also a big early inspiration to me. His bold landscape compositions, creative use of textures, and nuanced colour choices continue to influence my work. I had the pleasure of taking part in one of his linocut workshops, and it was a fantastic learning experience. </p>

        <h2 id="reduction">The reduction process</h2>
        <p>The next video shows a breakdown of the reduction linocut process. "Reduction" in this context refers to the reduction of the lino block as the artist carves away more material for each subsequent layer. As each layer is carved, the lino surface that was used to print the previous layer is removed. This means that once the artist has committed to an edition of, say, ten prints, it is impossible to produce more of the same image after the printing has begun. It is also impossible to go back and change layers after they have been printed. The reduction method is distinct from more traditional woodblock printing methods, which use separate blocks for each layer; thus allowing the artist to make changes to the layers, try different colours, and produce an unlimited number of prints.</p>

        <h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
        <p>One of the most crucial aspects of the reduction linocut process is accurately aligning the paper and block during printing; this is called registration. This was one of the most difficult things to get right when I was starting out, and didn't have any equipment. The following video shows a registration device developed by Laura Boswell. These days I use <a href="https://handprinted.co.uk/blogs/blog/registering-a-print-with-ternes-burton-pins" target="_blank">Ternes Burton registration pins</a>, which can quickly and simply take care of registration with arbitrary sized lino and paper.</p>

        <h2 id="awesome">Why reduction linocut is awesome</h2>
<p>Because of the irreversible nature of the process, reduction linocut is sometimes also called the "suicide method". The unknown factor also makes reduction linocut exciting. At the beginning of the process, the artist has only a mental picture and sketches of the final image. The first few layers appear sparse and abstract without the context of later details, and it requires a leap of faith to press on despite this. At the same time, there is a reassuring feeling of open-endedness; few commitments have been made and there is plenty of room to react and change the design as work progresses. </p>

<p>Each layer takes time to dry, and this stretches the process out over several days. By the time work has begun on the final layers, the initial uncertainty has been replaced by the immutability of the work so far. Wouldn't it have been nice to add a few more leaves to that tree in the background? Perhaps a more muted colour might have better suited the water? Too late. The previous layers are indelibly marked on the paper, and the printing surface has been destroyed; the shreds of carved lino are all that remain of the tree. The reduction process does not allow for such indecision. The only way is onwards, towards the next layer and the completion of the print. </p>

<p>During this whole process, the texture of the image is uniquely influenced by the mechanics of cutting lino. The raised areas of the lino transfer ink. The carved areas do not. There is no in-between. The potential for detail work is limited; very thin raised areas can buckle or squash under the pressure of printing and leave thicker lines than intended. Cuts that are too thin may become filled with ink and fail to show up in the image. </p>

<p>At all points in the process, reduction linocut forces decision and simplicity. Tight control of the printing parameters is balanced by the inherent unpredictability of the process. All of this conspires to produce a final image which is rarely exactly how the artist imagined it. </p>
